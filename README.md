# A password generator

In this code, we define a function called generate_password that takes four parameters: length (the desired length of the password), use_uppercase (a value that indicates whether to include uppercase letters), use_digits (a value that indicates whether to include digits), and use_symbols ( a value that indicates whether symbols should be included).

The function determines which characters to include in the password based on user-specified requirements and generates the password using the random.choices() function to randomly select characters from the string.

We then ask the user to enter the desired password length and whether to include capital letters, digits, and symbols. We convert the input to values ​​using .lower() == "y" and pass these values ​​to the generate_password function.
